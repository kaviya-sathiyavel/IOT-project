# Reduction of Electricity Theft Using IoT

## Introduction
Electricity theft is a major issue that results in significant revenue losses for power companies and can cause instability in power distribution networks. This project, **Reduction of Electricity Theft Using IoT**, is designed to detect and prevent unauthorized power usage using **IoT-based smart monitoring systems**. The system continuously monitors electricity consumption and detects anomalies that indicate possible theft.

## Objectives
- To develop an **IoT-based real-time electricity monitoring system**.
- To detect unauthorized power usage and tampering in the distribution network.
- To alert authorities in case of suspicious electricity consumption.
- To provide **automated power cut-off** in case of confirmed electricity theft.

## Working Principle
The system uses **smart meters, IoT sensors, and cloud-based analytics** to monitor electricity consumption and detect theft patterns:
1. **Smart Meter Integration**: The system measures the power consumption of authorized users.
2. **Tamper Detection**: Sensors monitor voltage, current, and bypass attempts.
3. **Data Transmission**: The readings are transmitted to a central server/cloud using **Wi-Fi, GSM, or LoRaWAN**.
4. **Anomaly Detection**: A machine learning model or threshold-based algorithm detects unusual consumption patterns.
5. **Real-time Alerts**: If electricity theft is suspected, notifications are sent to authorities via SMS, email, or an IoT dashboard.
6. **Automated Response**: The system can trigger a **relay-based cut-off mechanism** to disconnect power if necessary.

## Components Used
1. **Smart Energy Meter** (for measuring voltage, current, and power)
2. **Arduino/Raspberry Pi/ESP32** (as the IoT controller)
3. **Current & Voltage Sensors** (ACS712, ZMPT101B)
4. **Relay Module** (for automated power cut-off)
5. **GSM/Wi-Fi Module** (for data transmission)
6. **Cloud Platform** (AWS IoT, Firebase, or Thingspeak for data storage and monitoring)
7. **Machine Learning Algorithm** (optional, for theft detection based on patterns)

## Implementation Steps
1. **Sensor Setup**: Installed voltage and current sensors on the power line.
2. **Data Acquisition**: Integrated a smart meter to measure power usage and connected it to a microcontroller.
3. **Wireless Data Transmission**: Configured Wi-Fi/GSM module to send real-time data to the cloud.
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Developed a basic threshold-based algorithm to detect irregularities in power consumption.
5. **Alert Mechanism**: Implemented a notification system to send alerts via SMS and cloud dashboard.
6. **Automated Power Cut-off**: Designed and tested a relay-based cut-off mechanism to disconnect power in case of theft.
7. **Testing & Refinement**: Conducted multiple tests to fine-tune the system and improve accuracy in theft detection.
